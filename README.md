# :grin: A simple emoji picker

A little Alfred-style emoji finder/picker thingy.

_Requires a Mac with a modern browser._

## Tryin’ it out

1. Serve this directory locally
* Press `⌘` twice
  * A wild prompt appears!
* Type some letters
  * You can search for emoji by name
* Click an emoji
  * The emoji you click is copied to your clipboard

## But why?

**First**, the emoji-picker-thing on my Mac is broken.

**Second**, I wanted to practice flex-box stuff.

**Third**, I always wondered how to copy stuff to the system clipboard.
